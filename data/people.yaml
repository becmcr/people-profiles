    as the ASPCA, Philabundance, sexual assault awareness, mental health, and suicide
    prevention. Issues that college students care about.    He moved to United States
    from Puerto Rico with his family and overcame the language barrier by learning
    English in just one year. He remains involved in student government and encourages
    others to pursue innovative ideas that may seem impossible. Currently, he works

  bio: I am very passionate about research in organizational behavior, especially
    impression management--the process in which we influence others' perceptions of
    us.    During the spring semester of 2014, I took on a monastic and ascetic lifestyle
    through an experiential class called "Living Deliberately." The following summer,
    I went to Thailand to teach English to monks and learn more about Buddhism and
    mindfulness. I believe that cultivating mindfulness and awareness is one thing
    we all can and should do.    On campus, I founded a hip hop rap group called "KLASS."
    I believe that the experience of writing lyrics, rapping, and sharing it with
    the community has incredible potential for self-empowerment and "other-empowerment."    As
    an aspiring educator and musician, I want to connect the knowledge from academia
    and mindfulness practices with the medium of rap and music to help others cultivate
    awareness and self-empowerment.

  bio: During my senior year at Penn, I reflected on what made work meaningful to
    me. I struggled to find it in the glamor of finance and consulting, and instead
    looked to how I could use my interest in law and economics to create value outside
    of the private sector. At the core of most economic issues is a lack of reliable,
    legal infrustructure. As I venture into the legal profession, I hope to bring
    increased access to legal information and minimize the information costs that
    burden social entrepreneurs.

  bio: My goal is to create a network of schools where each student defines his or
    her own goals and learning objectives. I believe in democratic education, because
    I have seen its potential for transformation firsthand.      In the summer of
    2012, a college friend and I, taught 2D animation to over 40 underserved youth
    in Nuestra Escuela, a democratic school, in Puerto Rico. At Nuestra Escuela, I
    met students who were involved in gangs and dealt drugs. I met one teenager whose
    brother was killed in front of his eyes. Today, this teenager, and others like
    him, have been able to graduate from high school and get jobs in the formal sector.
    This is all thanks to the fact that at Nuestra Escuela, each student defines his
    or her own goals and learning objectives. The teachers are there to help them
    achieve their goals.     This is why I believe in democratic schools. I welcome
    you to join me on this journey.

  bio: When you learn to build things with code, you are not just learning how to
    wield computers to do your bidding, you learn that you can create anything that
    you see missing in the world. You learn that anything that you can imagine, you
    can create. The question that you begin to ask yourself, "what should I make"
    and then further down the line, "why should I make it?".    We believe that by
    creating the next generation of hackers, people who create what they see missing
    in the world and aren't afraid to break the rules, we are creating the next generation
    of change-makers, the people who are going to solve the world's biggest problems.

    I've been inspired by the raw talent in the youth I've worked with. GYU alums
    have organized to fight budget cuts to their public school district through state-level

    helped raise the housing capacity of Philadelphia's only shelter for homeless
    veterans by 64%.     In practice, Global Youth United partners Philadelphia schools
    with a team of mentors who are undergraduates at the University of Pennsylvania.
    Together, these students use the GYU Problem Solving Curriculum© to identify issues
    in their community, then design and implement strategies to affect the issue.    The
    work of GYU students has been invigorating in my personal life and leaves me with
    high hopes for a future filled with positive social change. We're growing quickly
    and are looking for investors and -most importantly- talent!

  bio: 'My learning journey began my sophomore year in sociology where I uncovered
    the ugly truth I lived through plainly stated over and over again: Poverty entraps
    sick individuals in a cycle of illness, disease and poor health they cannot easily
    escape. In my studies, I took a three-pronged approach, studying health communications,
    community leadership and organizing, and medical sociology. By understanding health
    change models, community behavioral health, and medical history, I learned theory
    and combined with my clinical volunteering and bio-medical research, I gained
    insights into the true meaning of medicine, beyond the science, diagnoses and
    technicalities.   I saw how patients and physicians worked together to create
    an accessible, well-designed and caring treatment plan. Quickly, I discovered
    this: for a patient to get better, a cohesive health care community must be created.
    Now I am working to harness this knowledge, leadership and entrepreneurial skills
    to create a model for better health care access & delivery.'

  bio: 10+ years working for non-profits focused on innovation, creating networks
    of sustainable micro-communities and hosting crafted gatherings. During my Masters,
    I found a home in the social enterprise space, combining my love for making an
    impact with my entrepreneurial spirit.    With extensive experience in multi-platform
    storytelling, design thinking and public speaking, I've become an expert in immersive
    experiences, which led me to organize and host multiple TEDx Conferences.     I've
    been a guest lecturer on the joys (and pains) of entrepreneurship at University
    of Pennsylvania and facilitated workshops on design thinking at Columbia.     Currently,
    launching the Terranga app and interested in meeting other entrepreneurs in the
    travel+social impact space, and thoughtful leaders in social enterprise.
